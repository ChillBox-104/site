# Join ChillBox104 - Guide

import ServerOfflineWarning from './ServerOfflineWarning'
import QuickPlayList from './QuickPlayList'

<ServerOfflineWarning />
**Java IP:** `chillbox104.minehut.gg`
**Bedrock IP:** `chillbox104.bedrock.minehut.gg`
## Quick Launch:
<QuickPlayList />

## The server is offline, what do I do?
If the server is offline, join the minehut lobby (`minehut.gg`) and type the command "`/join chillbox104`"

## I can't join the Minehut lobby
If you can't join the minehut lobby, it is probably because Minehut is offline. If this is the case, you should join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cGBPV5kUHP) or wait for about one day or two.

## The server still hasn't started
If the server didn't start in arround ~5 minutes after you typed the command above said, this is probably our fault. Please report any error messages you encountered in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cGBPV5kUHP).
Any updates/fixes will be announce there too!
